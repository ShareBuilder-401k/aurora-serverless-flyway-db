# Aurora Serverless Flyway DB

Aurora Serverless Flyway DB is a template project that is used to setup an [Amazon Aurora Serverless Database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) that is integrated with [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) to manage database migrations. This integration is accomplished through the use of an ECS Fargate task along with the help of GitHub Actions.

## Overview

This section will give an overview of some of the technologies used for this project.

### AWS

#### Amazon Aurora Serverless

[Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) is a database solution that is able to automatically start, stop, and scale capacity up and down based on usage making it a very cost-effective and easy to manage option for running a databse.

#### AWS Fargate

[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) is a serverless compute engine for containers. With Fargate we are able to run a docker container with flyway from the same VPC that the Amazon Aurora Serverless Database Cluster is in.

#### AWS Secrets Manager

[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) is a solution to store and protect applications secrets. It is used in this project to store user credentials for the database, a private key to an SSH key pair with the public key set as a Deploy Key on this repository, and the credentials for a Docker Registry. If using GitHub Packages to store the Flyway Docker image generated by the `flyway-build-docker-image-workflow`, the credentials will be from a Personal Access Token to this repo with `repo`, `write:packages`, and `read:packages` permissions.

#### AWS EC2

In order to limit access to this database, an [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) is used as a [bastion host](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/linux-bastion/) or gateway in the same subnet as the Aurora Serverless Database. By establishing an SSH connection to the bastion host, we are then able to connect to the RDS database through localhost port 5432.

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code solution used to provision and manage all of the AWS infrastructure used in this project, other than S3 and Secrets Manager resources. The Terraform files are located in the `infrastructure/` folder by each main component in a subfolder. Available variables and default values can be found in the `variables.tf` files of each subfolder. They can be configured using `<region>.tfvars` files in the `var-files/` folder.

### Flyway

[Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) is an open source tool for managing database migrations. Flyway will search through all files in the `sql/` folder finding any file that matches `V<version>__<Version_Description>.sql` for versioned migrations or `R__<Procedure_name>.sql` for repeatable migrations. Flyway is only concerned with the names of the individual files and does not actually care about the structure. The structure is just for developers to better organize their code.

Versioned migrations are migrations that are executed in order according to their version. This is important to keep in mind when creating a migration that could depend on another migration (ex: Table A column references Table B so the Table A migration would need to have a lower version and be applied first). Flyway keeps track of the current database version using the `flyway_schema_history` table.

Repeatable migrations are migrations that are reapplied every time their checksum changes (every time the file is modified). These are good for database objects that can be maintained in a single file in version control, such as stored procedures and bulk inserts. Repeatable migrations are always applied after versioned migrations.

For this project, flyway will search through the `sql/` directory to find all filenames matching either `V<version>__<Version_Description>.sql` for versioned migrations or `R__<Repeatable_Description>.sql` fro repeatable migrations.

### GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a CI/CD solution through GitHub that allows for the creation of workflows for this project. These workflows are used to manage infrastructure using terraform, manage the aurora serverless database through the creation and restoration of database snapshots, trigger a standalone ECS task to run flyway migrations on the database, build the docker image for this repo configured to run flyway from the ECS task, and even generate the database schema as markdown and append it to this `README.md` file.

## Getting Started

This section will go over the steps to setup this project and get a database up and running.

### Repository Setup

1. Above this repository's file list, click the **Use this template** button.
2. Follow the prompts to set the repository owner, name, and visibility and to optionally include all branches if desired.
3. In the new repository, navigate to **Actions** from the top menu bar and click **Enable Actions on this repository**.
4. Navigate to **Settings -> Secrets** and click **New secret**
5. Add a secret for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` for the AWS account credentials.
6. Repeat step 4 and add a secret for `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for the AWS account credentials.
7. Navigate to **Settings -> Deploy Keys** and click **Add deploy key**
8. In a terminal, run `ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<repository_name> read-repository" -f <file_path>`
   - Example: `ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "aurora-serverless-flyway-db read-repository" -f ~/.ssh/aurora-serverless-flyway-db`
9. Back in GitHub, copy the contents of the public key file generated from the `ssh-keygen` command into the **Key** section. The public key file will be in the format of `<file_path>.pub`.
10. Add a title and click **Add key**. Write access is not needed for this deploy key.
11. Click the profile picture in the top right corner and click **Settings**
12. Click **Developer settings** in the settings menu.
13. Select **Personal access tokens** and click **Generate new token**.
14. Select `repo` and `read:packages` scope and click **Generate token**.
15. Copy the generated token and store it in a secure location.
  - This token will be used by the Flyway task to pull the docker image. It can also be used to trigger GitHub actions by creating `repository_dispatch` events.

### Secrets Manager Setup

1. Login to the AWS console.
2. Navigate to **Services -> Secrets Manager**.
3. Click **Store a new secret**.
4. Select **Other type of secrets**.
5. Under **Specify the key/value pairs to be stred in this secret**, select **Plaintext** and copy the contents of the private key for the deploy key generated in step 8 of [Repository Setup](#repository-setup).
6. Select an encryption key or use the `DefaultEncryptionKey` and click **Next**.
7. Specify a **Secret name** and **Description** for the secret and click **Next**.
    - I like to name my secrets describing their use separating descriptors by the `@` symbol. Ex: `github@<repo_owner>@<repo_path>@repository-deploy-key`.
8. Select **Disable automatic rotation** and click **Next**.
9. Click **Store**.
10. Repeat steps 3-9 to store the personal access token from step 15 of [Repository Setup](#repository-setup). Instead of storing the value as plaintext, store it as **Secret key/value**. The pairs are:
    - key: `username`, value: the username used to create the personal access token
    - key: `password`, value: the personal access token from the generate token step
      - Example secret name: `github@<github_user>@registry_token`
11. Repeat steps 3-9 to store a username and secure password key value pair for the master credentials of the database.
    - Example secret name: `<db_engine>@<dbname>@<db_table>@<db_user_name>`
      -  Ex: `postgresql@auroradb@master@sqladmin`
12. Repeat steps 3-9 to store username and secure password key value pairs for any additional database users. This process will also be used to add new users during development.
    - The additional users used in the sample sql code are:
      - `postgresql@auroradb@master@read_only`
      - `postgresql@auroradb@sample@sample_application`

### Terraform Infrastructure Setup

The Terraform infrastructure is split into the the following sections:

- aurora-db
- bastion
- ecs-cluster
- fargate-iam
- flyway-fargate-task

Each section has a `variables.tf` file describing the variables that can be provided for the infrastructure and any default values if there are any. These variables are provided via `var-files/<region>.tfvars` files (Ex: `us-west-2.tfvars`).

An S3 Bucket to store Terraform state files is required.

#### **Aurora-DB**

Example config for us-west-2 is provided in `var-files/us-west-2.tfvars`.

```
region = "us-west-2"

vpc_name = "default-us-west-2"

registry_token = "github@mreed19@registry_token" # CHANGE ME

auroradb_cluster_name = "auroradb-cluster"

task_iam_role = "flyway-migration-role"

repository_deploy_key_secret = "github@Sharebuilder-401k@aurora-serverless-flyway-db@repository-deploy-key" # CHANGE ME

app_version = "0.0.0"

cloudwatch_log_group = "/ecs_logs"
```

#### **Bastion**

The infrastructure files to create a Bastion Host EC2 Instance. This instance will be used to establish an SSH Tunnel into the same VPC as the Aurora DB instance so a connection can be established from a local system. An `sshtunnel.sh` script has been provided if this method is used to establish a connection.

An AWS Security Group is created allowing SSH ingress to the host from a provided list of CIDR ranges. While the SSH key helps to secure the instance, it is always a good idea to limit access to only the CIDR ranges that will be accessing the instance.

An SSH key pair is required to connect to the Bastion Host Instance. This key pair can be generated using the same command as step 8 in [Repository Setup](#repository-setup).

`ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<description>" -f <file_path>`

The public key (.pub file) generated by the above command needs to be stored in S3 to be used for this setup.

The available variables and default values are as follows:

| name | type | description | default |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `region` | string | The AWS region | `N/A` |
| `vpc_name` | string | The name of the VPC to deploy the bastion host in | `N/A` |
| `subnet_names` | list(string) | The list of subnet names to deploy the bastion host in | `N/A` |
| `bastion_sg_name` | string | The name of the bastion security group to be created | `bastion-sg` |
| `ingress_cidrs` | list(string) | The list of cidr ranges allowed to connect to the bastion host | `N/A` |
| `bastion_key_name` | string | The name of the Key pair used to connect to the bastion host | `bastion-key-pair` |
| `public_key_bucket` | string | The S3 bucket that the public key file for the bastion key pair is stored in | `N/A` |
| `public_key_path` | string | The S3 path to the public key file for the bastion key pair | `N/A` |
| `bastion_host_name` | string | The name of the bastion host | `bastion-host` |

Example config for us-west-2 is provided in `var-files/us-west-2.tfvars`.

```
region = "us-west-2"

vpc_name = "default-us-west-2"

subnet_names = ["default-us-west-2a", "default-us-west-2b", "default-us-west-2c"]

public_key_bucket = "sharebuilder401k-ssh-keys-us-west-2" # CHANGE ME

public_key_path = "public/bastion-host-key.pub" # CHANGE ME

ingress_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # CHANGE ME
```

### GitHub Actions Config Setup

This project uses a `config.json` file to configure values for the GitHub Actions Workflow. Since GitHub Actions does not currently support manually invoking workflows from the GitHub actions console, `trigger_workflow.sh`, a script to invoke workflows through the use of [`repository_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) events, has been included with the project. This script will parse `config.json` to retrieve values to build the HTTP request and payload to generate the `repository_dispatch` event.

### Deploy Infrastructure

Infrastructure can be deployed through GitHub Actions by using the `trigger_workflow.sh` script. To initiate the `deploy_infrastructure` workflows, do the following:

1. Create an environment variable to store a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope (such as the one created in steps 11-15 of [Repository Setup](#repository-setup)). The variable name should match the value of the `githubTokenName` property in config.json.
    - Ex: `export GITHUB_AURORA_ACTIONS_TOKEN="<token_value>"`
2. Run `./trigger_workflow.sh`
    - ![trigger-workflow-menu](assets/trigger-workflow-menu.png)
3. Enter `2` for `deploy_infrastructure`.
4. Select the region you would like to deploy to. (Menu options are created based on [Infrastructure Obect Config](#infrastructure-config-object) property keys)
    - ![deploy-infrastructure-region-menu](assets/deploy-infrastructure-region-menu.png)
5. Select the infrastructure to be deployed.
    - ![deploy-infrastructure-selection-menu](assets/deploy-infrastructure-selection-menu.png)
6. A success message should be displayed with a link to GitHub actions for the project
    - ![deploy-infrastructure-invocation](assets/deploy-infrastructure-invocation.png)
7. Navigate to the GitHub actions link and select the running `deploy_infrastructure` workflow to monitor its progress.
    - ![github-actions-deploy-infrastructure-all-workflows](assets/github-actions-deploy-infrastructure-all-workflows.png)
8. Select the running `deploy` job on the left hand side to view the job logs
    - ![github-actions-deploy-infrastructure-running-workflow](assets/github-actions-deploy-infrastructure-running-workflow.png)

If deploying all of the infrastructure, they should be deployed in the following order:
  1. aurora-db
  2. bastion (optional)
  3. ecs-cluster
  4. fargate-iam
  5. flyway-fargate-task

#### **Destroy Infrastructure**

Destroying infrastructure follows the same steps as deploying infrastructure. Just select the `trigger_workflow.sh` menu option for `destroy_infrastructure` instead and follow the prompts.
